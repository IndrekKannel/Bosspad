# Bosspad  

I designed a 9 key and 1 encoder macropad for the real bosses. It also has an OLED screen and is designed to be mouted on a vertical surface.  
I plan on using it as a button box for sim racing. 
It uses QMK firmware and supports VIA

## PCB

I designed the PCB with KiCad

## Case

I designed the case in Fusion360 and it can be printed in 2 parts.  
It is assembled with 4 M3x16 screws and 4 M3x5x4mm heatset inserts.
